# Codility Ruby solutions

Codility is an online platform for recruiters to provide programming tests to their candidates.
It also offers to programmers more than 50 challenges through lessons covering algorithms and data structures.
Once a solution is submitted, correctness and, most of the time, performance are assessed through various tests. 
This repository is meant to gather solutions that reached a 100% score to these challenges using Ruby language.
